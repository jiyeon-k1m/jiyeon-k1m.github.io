## Ji-Yeon's website

This is the source code of Kim Ji-Yeon personal website.

Feel free to use my source code as your template.    
I have modified some codes using [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

Overall design is inspired by [Ayush Tewari's website](https://ayushtewari.com/) and open-source scripts are adapted from [Michael Niemeyer template](https://m-niemeyer.github.io/).   
I hope this open-sourcing could help the start of your journey!
